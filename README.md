# Roblox-Moderation-Tools-For-Dummies  

This is a very easy to use client that uses serval of Roblox's APIs. Its main purpose is to make it easier to find users and bad actors that should be moderated. On statup the program will ask prompt weather or not you want to check to see if users are banned. This is optional becuase it uses a different API that has a low rate limit. The 'ban checker' also gets the username, display name, and the description for each userID (if thier not banned).
